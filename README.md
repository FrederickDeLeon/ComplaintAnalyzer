# ComplaintAnalyzer

This is a Python-based program that fetches 311 complaint data from NYC's Open Data API, categorizes complaint types, and then outputs summary statistics. It is still a work in progress, but as of now, it can fetch 311 data from the publicly available NYC dataset, categorize and count each of the complaint types, and display the top 10 types of complaints in the dataset.

## Core Features:
* Fetch 311 data from publicly accessible NYC database (limited to 1000 records to keep program lightweight, but can be increased or reduced as needed) 
* Categorize 311 complaints into different types
* Count the number of complaints for each complaint type
* Output a list of the top 10 complaint types and the number of each complaint type in the data sampled

## WIP:
* Expand on data analysis, such as including what boroughs these complaints come from
* Visualization of the data, such as in a graph or pie chart
* Options/Choices based on user input
